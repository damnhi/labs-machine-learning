## Machine Learning Lab Summaries

### Lab 01 - Introduction to Data Handling
Initiated with acquiring California housing price data, setting up the work environment, and data analysis. Utilized `matplotlib` for data visualization and conducted correlation analysis and data preparation for training, including splitting into training and testing sets and saving in `.pkl` format.

### Lab 02 - Classification Techniques
Divided data into training and testing sets. Employed classifiers, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), for detecting the digit 0 from the MNIST dataset. Determined classifier quality using metrics, accuracy, and cross-validation, and recorded classifier accuracy and cross-validation results in `.pkl` files.

### Lab 03 - Regression Analysis
Performed linear regression, KNN for \( k=3 \) and \( k=5 \), and polynomial regression from 2nd to 5th degree. Analyzed the performance of regression functions and compared their behavior with the data distribution. Documented MSE values for training and testing sets and a list of tuples containing regression objects in `.pkl` files.
